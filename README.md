## Overview

`gnomesims` (pronounced 'genome sims') is an R package to perform genomic simulations with a focus on including gene-environment correlation. The package enables researchers to perform power analyses for studies using family-based designs that incorporate polygenic scores. It accompanies a paper on a simulation study titled 'A simulation study on detecting cultural transmission and sibling interaction using polygenic scores'. The pre-print is available here: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5461256/v1.
